BloodHound uses graph theory to reveal the hidden and often unintended
relationships within an Active Directory environment. Attackers can use
BloodHound to easily identify highly complex attack paths that would otherwise
be impossible to quickly identify. Defenders can use BloodHound to identify
and eliminate those same attack paths. Both blue and red teams can use
BloodHound to easily gain a deeper understanding of privilege relationships in
an Active Directory environment.
