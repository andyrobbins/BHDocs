Words about edges

AdminTo
^^^^^^^

This edge indicates that principal is a local administrator on the target
computer. By default, administrators have several ways to perform remote
code execution on Windows systems, including via RDP, WMI, WinRM, the
Service Control Manager, and remote DCOM execution.

Further, administrators have several options for impersonating other users
logged onto the system, including plaintext password extraction, token
impersonation, and injecting into processes running as another user.

Finally, administrators can often disable host-based security controls that
would otherwise prevent the aforementioned techniques.

Abuse Info
----------

There are several ways to pivot to a Windows system. If using Cobalt
Strike's beacon, check the help info for the commands "psexec", "psexec_psh",
"wmi", and "winrm". With Empire, consider the modules for Invoke-PsExec,
Invoke-DCOM, and Invoke-SMBExec.

With Metasploit, consider the modules "exploit/windows/smb/psexec",
"exploit/windows/winrm/winrm_script_exec", and
"exploit/windows/local/ps_wmi_exec".

Additionally, there are several manual methods for remotely executing code on
the machine, including via RDP, with the service control binary and
interaction with the remote machine's service control manager, and remotely
instantiating DCOM objects. For more information about these lateral movement
techniques, see the References section below.

**Gathering credentials**

The most well-known tool for gathering credentials from a Windows system is
mimikatz. mimikatz is built into several agents and toolsets, including
Cobalt Strike's beacon, Empire, and Meterpreter. While running in a high
integrity process with SeDebugPrivilege, execute one or more of mimikatz's
credential gathering techniques (e.g.: sekurlsa::wdigest,
sekurlsa::logonpasswords, etc.), then parse or investigate the output to
find clear-text credentials for other users logged onto the system.
            
You may also gather credentials when a user types them or copies them to
their clipboard! Several keylogging capabilities exist, several agents and
toolsets have them built-in. For instance, you may use meterpreter's
"keyscan_start" command to start keylogging a user, then "keyscan_dump" to
return the captured keystrokes. Or, you may use PowerSploit's
Invoke-ClipboardMonitor to periodically gather the contents of the user's
clipboard.

**Token Impersonation**

You may run into a situation where a user is logged onto the system, but
you can't gather that user's credential. This may be caused by a host-based
security product, lsass protection, etc. In those circumstances, you may
abuse Windows' token model in several ways. First, you may inject your agent
into that user's process, which will give you a process token as that user,
which you can then use to authenticate to other systems on the network. Or,
you may steal a process token from a remote process and start a thread in
your agent's process with that user's token. For more information about
token abuses, see the References tab.

**Disabling host-based security controls**

Several host-based controls may affect your ability to execute certain
techniques, such as credential theft, process injection, command line
execution, and writing files to disk. Administrators can often disable these
host-based controls in various ways, such as stopping or otherwise disabling
a service, unloading a driver, or making registry key changes. For more
information, see the References section below.

Opsec Considerations
--------------------

There are several forensic artifacts generated by the techniques described
above. For instance, lateral movement via PsExec will generate 4697 events on
the target system. If the target organization is collecting and analyzing those
events, they may very easily detect lateral movement via PsExec. 

Additionally, an EDR product may detect your attempt to inject into lsass and
alert a SOC analyst. There are many more opsec considerations to keep in mind
when abusing administrator privileges. For more information, see the References
section below.

MemberOf
^^^^^^^^

Groups in active directory grant their members any privileges the group itself
has. If a group has rights to another principal, users/computers in the group,
as well as other groups inside the group inherit those permissions.

Abuse Info
----------

No abuse is necessary. This edge simply indicates that a principal belongs to a
security group.

Opsec Considerations
--------------------

No opsec considerations apply to this edge.

HasSession
^^^^^^^^^^

When a user authenticates to a computer, they often leave credentials exposed on
the system, which can be retrieved through LSASS injection, token manipulation
or theft, or injecting into a user's process.

Any user that is an administrator to the system has the capability to retrieve
the credential material from memory if it still exists.

..note:: A session does not guarantee credential material is present, only possible.

Abuse Info
----------

When a user has a session on the computer, you may be able to obtain credentials for
the user via credential dumping or token impersonation. You must be able to move
laterally to the computer, have administrative access on the computer, and the user
must have a non-network logon session on the computer.

Once you have established a Cobalt Strike Beacon, Empire agent, or other implant on
the target, you can use mimikatz to dump credentials of the user that has a session
on the computer. While running in a high integrity process with SeDebugPrivilege,
execute one or more of mimikatz's credential gathering techniques (e.g.:
sekurlsa::wdigest, sekurlsa::logonpasswords, etc.), then parse or investigate the
output to find clear-text credentials for other users logged onto the system.

You may also gather credentials when a user types them or copies them to their
clipboard! Several keylogging capabilities exist, several agents and toolsets have
them built-in. For instance, you may use meterpreter's "keyscan_start" command to
start keylogging a user, then "keyscan_dump" to return the captured keystrokes. Or,
you may use PowerSploit's Invoke-ClipboardMonitor to periodically gather the contents
of the user's clipboard.

**Token Impersonation**

You may run into a situation where a user is logged onto the system, but you can't
gather that user's credential. This may be caused by a host-based security product,
lsass protection, etc. In those circumstances, you may abuse Windows' token model in
several ways. First, you may inject your agent into that user's process, which will
give you a process token as that user, which you can then use to authenticate to other
systems on the network. Or, you may steal a process token from a remote process and
start a thread in your agent's process with that user's token. For more information
about token abuses, see the References section below.

User sessions can be short lived and only represent the sessions that were present at
the time of collection. A user may have ended their session by the time you move to
the computer to target them. However, users tend to use the same machines, such as the
workstations or servers they are assigned to use for their job duties, so it can be
valuable to check multiple times if a user session has started.

Opsec Considerations
--------------------

An EDR product may detect your attempt to inject into lsass and alert a SOC analyst.
There are many more opsec considerations to keep in mind when stealing credentials or
tokens. For more information, see the References section.
